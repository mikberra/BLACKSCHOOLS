The building of our site isproof of this resistance, as the Board persisted in constructing new “colored” schools even afterthe law passed. Desegregation gained momentum under reformist Mayor Seth Low. In 1882, Lowappointed Philip A. White, the first African-American member of the Board of Education, whoopposed forced segregation. White was instrumental in passing a policy in 1883 that allowed Black students to attend any public school, though “colored” schools remained open for familieswho preferred them. By 1887, Low’s administration had renamed the colored schools to alignwith Brooklyn’s public school system. Thus, the Colored School No. 3 changed to “PS 69”.

This demographic shift led to the closure of P.S. 69 in 1901 – since then, the building was used for white students.

During this time, Williamsburg underwent further transformations – the area was redlined, and accessible to migrating populations. Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution in Europe found refuge in the neighborhood, followed by waves of Dominican and Puerto Rican immigrants, whose presence remains a defining characteristic of the area. The buildings at each side of the former School reflect these shifts: in the 1940s, the northern end of the block housed the "American Lithuanian Citizens’ Club," while the southernmost building was a synagogue. Today, both are Pentecostal churches serving the Latino community.

At the same time, half of the school’s block was demolished in 1984 to build La Cabana, an affordable housing development now home to mostly Latino residents. Both of these events took place just before gentrification started in the area, which would be declared as ‘The New Bohemia’ in a 1992 New Yorker cover.
