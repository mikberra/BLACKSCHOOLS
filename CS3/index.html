        In 1868, a coalition of African American parents, arguing their right as taxpayers to a quality school environment for their children, persuaded the education administrators to approve a new four-classroom brick building for some two hundred and twenty students, to be built on 270 Union Ave between Stagg and Scholes. Brooklyn’s first Black principal, Catherine T. Clow, would go on to serve the institution from 1876 until the turn of the century.

          Despite the 1873 Civil Rights Act, which aimed to end segregation, Brooklyn’s Board of Education resisted integrating Black students. The building of our site is proof of this resistance, as the Board persisted in constructing new “colored” schools even after the law passed. Desegregation gained momentum under reformist Mayor Seth Low. In 1882, Low appointed Philip A. White, the first African-American member of the Board of Education, who opposed forced segregation. White was instrumental in passing a policy in 1883 that allowed Black students to attend any public school, though “colored” schools remained open for families who preferred them. By 1887, Low’s administration had renamed the colored schools to align with Brooklyn’s public school system. Thus, the Colored School No. 3 changed to “PS 69”.

          However, the decline of the Black population in Williamsburg continued into the 1900s, when African Americans made up just 0.5% of the population. This demographic shift led to the closure of P.S. 69 in 1901 – since then, the building was used for white students.

          When the building stopped operations as a school in 1934, it was occupied by the Public Works Commission in the 1930s, and the Department of Sanitation later on. During this time, Williamsburg underwent further transformations – the area was redlined, and accessible to migrating populations. Jewish immigrants fleeing persecution in Europe found refuge in the neighborhood, followed by waves of Dominican and Puerto Rican immigrants, whose presence remains a defining characteristic of the area. The buildings at each side of the former School reflect these shifts: in the 1940s, the northern end of the block housed the "American Lithuanian Citizens’ Club," while the southernmost building was a synagogue. Today, both are Pentecostal churches serving the Latino community.

          In 1983, the former school found a new life as the home and studio of artists James O. and Linda Clark, arriving just as Williamsburg was beginning its transformation into a haven for artists and bohemians. At the same time, half of the school’s block was demolished in 1984 to build La Cabana, an affordable housing development now home to mostly Latino residents. Both of these events took place just before gentrification started in the area, which would be declared as ‘The New Bohemia’ in a 1992 New Yorker cover.
